# Awesome eCommerce App
Our team has built an e-commerce Site where users may peruse a list of available
items, add them to their shopping cart, and checkout with our included payment
system. With our app, users may also view their past purchase history and if
they are unsatisfied with their purchases, may return them and receive a full
refund. Items will be visible for unregistered users to preview, however they
will need to sign-up in order to buy our items.

This application works by combining a custom backend server and database with
our one of a kind front end client. Our team has built this app with love and
dedication. We welcome all feedback and tips to improve and grow. Thank you
for your time and attention!

## Planning, process, problem-solving Strategy
- Standup schedule: twice a day 9:05am/ 4:15pm
  - Standup meetings would cover what we did yesterday, what we will do today, and issues we're currently facing. 
  - Review and merge sessions following standup meeting
- We set off on our team project with mob programming for the backend API. Once this was set and we understood our intentions, we split up into pair programming for most of our tasks. Nearing the end of the project, we had a mix of pair and solo coding to fix bugs and other issues. 
- Tools: Github projects as our kanban board. 
- Problem solving strategy: Going through the docs and googling was our first point of attack. If we were stuck on an issue, we would come together as a group and attempt to solve it. If this still didn't work, an issue would be put in and we would tackle the problem with assistance from our instructors.
