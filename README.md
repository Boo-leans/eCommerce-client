# Awesome eCommerce App
Our team has built an e-commerce Site where users may peruse a list of available
items, add them to their shopping cart, and checkout with our included payment
system. With our app, users may also view their past purchase history and if
they are unsatisfied with their purchases, may return them and receive a full
refund. Items will be visible for unregistered users to preview, however they
will need to sign-up in order to buy our items.

This application works by combining a custom backend server and database with
our one of a kind front end client. Our team has built this app with love and
dedication. We welcome all feedback and tips to improve and grow. Thank you
for your time and attention!
